// Themed greybox environment manager — the single owner of a scene's stage floor plus its
// theme-driven scene chrome (background, fog, light intensities). Every view in the repo builds one
// over its `view`: the Studio's Simulation player, the course editor, the Real bench, and the
// headless video capturer. There is exactly ONE environment — a fogged cyclorama — and no walled
// variant, so a clip and the dashboard cannot show different places.
//
// `createEnvironment(view, { labels })` -> { setTheme, setStage, setSize, setFog, dispose }.
// `labels: false` builds the floor without the baked pitch / "PROTOTYPE" text (the grid still
// carries the scale) — a clean backdrop for a product shot.
//   - setTheme repaints the floor texture from the active palette and swaps scene.background / fog /
//     ground tint / light intensities (a cheap rebuild — new CanvasTextures);
//   - setStage is THE entry point: give it the shot's camera distance and it derives fog, then the
//     floor size from the fog, then the grid subdivision from the framing — and returns what it
//     derived, so a caller can report the numbers rather than recompute them;
//   - setSize / setFog are the primitives setStage drives; call them directly only to override one
//     axis of the derivation.
//   - dispose tears the whole thing down (floor geometry + texture + the extra fill light).

// The derivation constants behind `setStage`. Every one of these used to be a hard-coded number
// inside web/capture/capture.js, reachable only via `--preset hero`; naming them here is what makes
// "the video look" and "the Studio look" the same object rather than two that resemble each other.
//
//   fog*      — the fade, from the camera's standoff: near at 1.5x the subject distance (so the
//               subject itself is never fogged), far at 14x (so mid-ground reads as depth rather
//               than haze). The Min floors keep an extreme close-up from fogging its own floor out.
//   footprintFogMul — the floor runs to 4x the fog's far distance, which is the invariant that
//               matters: the plane's own EDGE is always well past the point it has faded to
//               background, so no shot can ever catch the stage ending.
//   grid*     — the metre pitch is kept honest (that label is the scale reference) and a finer mesh
//               is chosen from the shot's own framing, so an 82 mm airframe sits on something it
//               can be read against instead of on 1/12 of a bare metre square. A wide arena shot
//               resolves the subdivision to "coarser than the tile", i.e. none.
